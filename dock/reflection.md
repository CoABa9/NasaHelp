I leant alot about Git hub and how it is used. It is helpfull in alot of wasys, as to store code and share it with people. It has great time to edit and work on it with minamle issues.
Project planning helped me by organizing my work. It helped in fixing issues, and made the work easier to understand. 
The challenges I hade was at the mid way prosses as it got  litle confusing
I had alot of fun in the star of the project. 
I would like to make a more functioning code, that can actually be help to peple.
